TODO


* Units to update

The previous incarnation of the cassandra charm allowed the updating
of a subset of nodes. This is very useful for proving a change. This
should be reintroduced.


* Existing data

More extensive testing is needed for using existing data. When there
is a large cassandra data set start up and shutdown take longer.

1) Large data sets

2) Node startup with a pre-existing persistent storage volume with
a large data set.

3) When a node has had no persistent storage and persistent storage is
introduced after it has existing data on the "local" file system.
This is currently not supported


* Authentication

The previous incarnation of the cassandra charm supported cassandra
1.0.x which could utilize simple authentication. With modern cassandra
authentication is built in. This is currently not supported by the
charm and should be.


* Initial Tokens and Leader Election

The previous incarnation of the cassandra charm supported cassandra
1.0.x which did not support virtual nodes. This version utilized the
token-map-by-unitname and token-map-by-volid to map initial tokens
to each cassandra node.

This required an initial leader node to be the seed node. Therefore,
leader election was required. Juju does not currently handle leader
election (although it is in the works) so this was handled by the 
previous version of the charm.

With modern cassandra and the use of virtual nodes this is no longer
necessary.

For the purposes of backward compatibility we may want to re-introduce
these features.
